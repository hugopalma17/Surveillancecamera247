> **Turn your old Android device into an intelligent security camera system - reducing e-waste while enhancing home security.**

## üåç Mission: Fighting Android E-Waste

Every year, millions of Android devices become "obsolete" and end up in landfills, despite having perfectly functional cameras, processors, and sensors. **Surveillance Camera** gives these devices a meaningful second life as intelligent security systems.

### Why This Matters
- üì± **54 million tons** of e-waste generated globally each year
- üîã Old Android devices retain 80%+ of their functionality
- üè† Professional security cameras cost $200-500+ per unit
- üå± **Our solution:** Free, open-source, and environmentally conscious

## üöÄ What We're Building

A **power-efficient, intelligent security camera app** that transforms any Android device (API 26+) into a professional-grade surveillance system with:

### üß† Smart Detection
- **Motion Detection** - Lightweight pixel-difference algorithm
- **Object Recognition** - Google ML Kit integration (people, cars, animals)
- **Face Detection** - Automatic face capture and timestamping
- **OCR Text Recognition** - License plate and sign reading
- **Intelligent Recording** - Only records when motion + objects detected

### üîã Power Efficiency
- **Background Service** - Continuous monitoring with minimal battery drain
- **Frame Optimization** - Processes every 3rd frame to prevent overheating
- **Smart Throttling** - 2-second cooldown between ML analyses
- **Wake Lock Management** - Prevents device sleep during monitoring

### üíæ Smart Storage
- **Circular Storage** - Automatic 100GB limit with oldest file deletion
- **Organized Structure** - Separate folders for videos and face captures
- **Timestamped Files** - Easy identification and retrieval
- **Database Logging** - Minimal SQLite database for quick event search

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### **Frontend**
- **Jetpack Compose** - Modern Android UI toolkit
- **Material3** - Google's latest design system
- **CameraX** - Advanced camera API with lifecycle management

### **Backend**
- **Kotlin** - Primary development language
- **LifecycleService** - Background processing architecture
- **Google ML Kit** - On-device machine learning
- **Room Database** - Local data persistence

### **Intelligence Layer**
- **Object Detection** - Pre-trained models for real-world objects
- **Face Detection** - Fast, privacy-focused face recognition
- **Text Recognition** - OCR for license plates and signage
- **Motion Detection** - Custom algorithm optimized for mobile devices

### **Performance**
- **Hardware Acceleration** - GPU/NPU utilization where available
- **Memory Management** - Automatic cleanup and optimization
- **Thermal Protection** - Frame skipping to prevent overheating

### **AI-Assisted Development**
- **GitHub Copilot** - Code generation, debugging, and optimization assistance
- **Google Gemini** - Architecture planning, problem-solving, and documentation
- **Collaborative AI Development** - Leveraging multiple AI models for comprehensive project development
- **Human-AI Partnership** - Combining human creativity with AI efficiency for rapid prototyping

**Critical Human Expertise Required:**
- **Technical Problem-Solving** - AI tools require experienced developers to guide debugging strategies and suggest alternative approaches
- **Architectural Decision-Making** - Complex system design decisions need human expertise to avoid infinite loops and dead ends
- **Context-Aware Debugging** - When builds fail or apps crash, human intuition and technical experience drive the problem-solving process
- **Strategic Direction** - AI excels at implementation but needs human vision for project direction and feature prioritization

*This project showcases modern AI-assisted development practices, where human vision and AI capabilities work together to tackle complex challenges like Android e-waste reduction. **Important Note:** Without experienced technical guidance behind the prompts, AI tools can easily get stuck in debugging loops or miss critical architectural insights. The human developer's ability to suggest new debugging paths, recognize patterns, and pivot strategies was essential for overcoming complex issues like Gradle cache corruption, ML Kit integration challenges, and Android emulator limitations.*
